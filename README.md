# Source translated text for encoronavirus.org

## Useful info to get started 

* We use plain text (markdown), one can paste own trasnlation from any source
  * [Markdown Reference](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* Each language has a directory
* Files can be 
 (1) added, edited in place via web browser or via git 
 (2) GUI or 
 (3) command line.
* The easiest option is (1). Once a file is edited, the commit message (just below the editing window) can include both language and changelog (e.g. "changelog 20 Italian"
* The changelog is maintained also separately in the root directory of the repo
* Editors are used as collaborators. Each editor works **only** on his/her own directory, not touching the rest (otherwise we need a more complex procedure, which we don't want now
